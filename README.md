# dots
My dotfiles, mostly managed using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

_Chezmoi_, obviously, for home directory shenanigans, and I'm still working on a good
way of incorporating _Ansible_ as a build step so my systems have the same foundation
(installed programs and anything else relevant).

I value cross-platform compatibility, so I'm trying out [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html)
as my terminal and [Starship](https://starship.rs/) as my prompt.
