# dots
My dotfiles, managed using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) and
[ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).

--

Ansible for configuring programs/programming languages, and chezmoi is for the
home directory + any addons.

I value cross-platform compatibility, so I'm testing
Wezterm as my terminal and  
Starship as my prompt.
